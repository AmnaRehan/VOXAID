        "response": "Oh, my dear, it sounds like you're carrying a really heavy feeling right now, feeling stressed all the time and not even knowing why. That must be incredibly frustrating and frankly, quite exhausting to navigate.\n\nPlease know that it's so common for stress to just... settle in, sometimes without a clear trigger we can immediately point to. You are absolutely not alone in experiencing this kind of pervasive feeling, even when its source feels mysterious.\n\nFor now, perhaps we can just acknowledge that it's there. It's okay not to have all the answers right away. Sometimes, just giving ourselves permission to *feel* the stress, without needing to understand or fix it instantly, can be a really gentle first step. We can gently explore this together, at your own pace, whenever you feel ready. Just bringing it out into the open like this is a brave and important step."

        "response": "Oh, my dear, that sounds incredibly tough. To feel misunderstood by the people you care about, and then to carry the weight of loneliness on top of that \u2013 it makes perfect sense that you're feeling this way.\n\nPlease know that it's okay to feel exactly what you're feeling right now. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge those feelings, and I want you to know you're not alone in experiencing them. Many people, at various points in their lives, go through periods where they feel a disconnect from those around them.\n\nI'm so sorry you're going through this right now. I'm here to listen, without judgment, if you'd like to share more about what's been happening, or even just what kind of understanding you feel is missing. Take a deep breath, if you can. Your feelings are valid, and I'm here with you."

        "response": "Oh, my dear, it sounds like you're carrying a really heavy load right now, and that feeling of fear about the future, coupled with constant overthinking, must be incredibly exhausting and unsettling. Please know that it's completely understandable to feel this way. Many, many people experience moments, or even longer periods, where the \"what ifs\" become overwhelming and the path ahead feels shrouded in uncertainty.\n\nTake a deep breath with me, if you can. Just acknowledging how you feel is a brave first step. It takes a lot of energy to constantly run through scenarios in your mind, and it's natural for that to lead to feelings of fear and anxiety.\n\nI want you to know that your feelings are valid. It's okay to feel scared, and it's okay to be overwhelmed by your thoughts. You're not alone in this, and there's nothing wrong with you for experiencing these emotions.\n\nPerhaps, in this moment, could we just acknowledge the strength it takes for you to keep going even with these heavy feelings? And maybe, just for a moment, could we gently try to bring your attention to something small and comforting in the present? Sometimes, when our minds race ahead, finding an anchor in the now can offer a tiny bit of respite.\n\nI'm here to listen, without judgment, for as long as you need. How does it feel to just hear that your feelings are understood?"

        "response": "Oh, my dear, hearing you say that truly touches my heart. That sounds like an incredibly heavy feeling to carry, and it takes so much courage to even voice it.\n\nI want you to know that I am truly hearing you right now. It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed to the point of wanting to give up when things feel incredibly challenging or painful. Those feelings can be so powerful, and they can make everything seem impossible.\n\nPlease know that you are not alone in experiencing moments like these. Many people, at various points in their lives, have felt that profound weariness and the desire to just stop. It doesn't make you weak; it makes you human, especially when you're facing difficulties.\n\nI'm here, just listening, without judgment. You don't have to carry this by yourself. If you feel comfortable, I'm here to listen to anything you want to share about what's been feeling particularly heavy for you lately. Even just acknowledging these feelings together can sometimes offer a little bit of relief."
